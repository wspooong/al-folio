I am a `Data Engineer` at the [Communication Data and Network Analytics Lab](https://cdna.survey.sinica.edu.tw/index_en.html) (CDNA), situated within the Research Center for Humanities and Social Sciences (RCHSS) at Academia Sinica.

While my academic background lies in Sociology, I have developed a comprehensive skill set in data science through self-study. With 2 years of practical experience, including `data collection`, `data cleaning`. My expertise extends to `Natural Language Processing(NLP)` including `topic modeling`, `document similarity`, and `text generation`. I also have a good understanding of language models like `Word2Vec` and `Transformer-based` model.

I completed my Master's degree in Sociology at Tunghai University. In my thesis, I focused on utilizing the qualitative approach called `Sequential Analysis` from `Objective Hermeneutics` to understand how individuals in Taiwan perceive entering higher education. My passion for sociology stems from my interest in exploring how people interact with each other and how these interactions shape society's social structure.

   - Inpired by: [Keyword Analysis (GroundAI)](https://keywords.groundedai.company/api/keyword_analysis/) 
   - [Demo](https://ndltd-tw-recommendation-system.fly.dev/#/)

2. Weird Keywords Abstract Generation
    - This project aims to test both the Bloom model and GPT-3 by generating possible paper titles when given any keyword. The goal is to see who can come up with the most creative and far-fetched ideas.
    - Tech: Network Analysis, GPT, Bloom for text generation.
