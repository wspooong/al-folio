I am a `Data Engineer` at the [Communication Data and Network Analytics Lab](https://cdna.survey.sinica.edu.tw/index_en.html) (CDNA), situated within the Research Center for Humanities and Social Sciences (RCHSS) at Academia Sinica.

While my academic background lies in Sociology, I have developed a comprehensive skill set in data science through self-study. With 2 years of practical experience, I possess expertise in `data collection`, `data cleaning`, and natural language processing, encompassing various techniques such as Word2Vec, BERT, and topic modeling.

My background includes a Master's degree in Sociology from Tunghai University, with a research focus on human behavior and social structures. My Master's thesis used Sequential Analysis from Objective Hermeneutics to explore the attitudes of individuals in Taiwan towards higher education, with the goal of uncovering the complex interplay between individuals, society, and education.
