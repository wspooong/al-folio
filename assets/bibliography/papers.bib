  abstract = "In Taiwan, vocational education is not preferred. The students of Taipei Municipal Daan Vocational High School (abbr. TAIVS) are exceptions, because they choose to go to vocational high schools instead of academic high schools. The reason why those students apply for TAIVS is worthy of investigation. We use the sequential analysis as our research method which originates from Objective Hermeneutics.
            According to our analyses, we find that the student’s motivation is basically based on Parents’ demand. Furthermore, parents’ demand is conducted by the pursuit of “Good School”, and we named that the “Structure of Credentialism.” Under this structure, TAIVS is an alternative to “Good School”, so people choose vocational education.",
